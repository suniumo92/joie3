    "We chose \"Monitoring BBC podcasts\" as our dataset. There are three datasets in \"Monitoring BBC podcasts\", one is about word timings which describes information of \"start time\",\"end time\" as well as \"word confidence\" of each word. Another one is about \"transcripts with punctuation and sentence level timings\". This dataset shows the time of a sentence and also provide the number of the word in each sentence, also the \"speakerId\"(the id of speaker) and \"summary prob\"(the probability that this sentence will appear in an extractive summary) as well as other information in this sentence. The third one is related to the name of place which be hightlighted.\n",

    "I find that most speakers' speaking speed are between 0.30-0.35(from chart 1) and totally speakers speak slower on June 23rd(from chart2). From chart3 and chart4 I find that most speakers speak slower on June 23rd and most of them have little speed ranges. From chart1 and chart2 it also can be found that the fewer the people the faster the speed. And the date data can be related to an event date in real life, it is \"Brexit vote\". It is an importent event in real life. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the hypothesise1 is when there are some important thing happening, the speakers will speak slowly. From chart2 it can be found the speakers spoke slower on June 23rd and spoke faster on June 22nd and 24th. I think this is because the speakers are more cautious on special days and they need to ensure they read every word  correct and maybe they seldom broadcast such content so they are not familiar with that. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesise2 is the more speakers the slower the speed. From chart1 and chart2 we can find that on 23rd there are 10 people and on the 24th there are 8 people as well as on the 22nd there are only 6 people. And the speed on 23rd is slower than that on 24th and the speed on 24th is slower than that on 22nd. The hypothesise3 is that BBC likes using the speaker who has steady speaking speed. From chart3 and chart4 we can find that most of the speakers have a steady speaking speed. So combined hypothesise2 and hypothesise3, I think the reason is the speaker who has a steady speaking speed represent who has skillful broadcast skills so this kind of speakers have more opportunities and they can work almost everyday and the work experience also make them be familiar with their job. So when the new speakers join in the speaking speed will slow down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesise4 is that when some important thing appear, there will be more speakers. This also can be found from chart1. I think that is because there are more content need to be reported, so they need more people to finish it on time or report more information.  "
